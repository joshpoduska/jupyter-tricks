Click on `Scheduled Jobs` and schedule this notebook to run on a recurring basis. Each run will update
the notebook.

3. Turn a whole notebook into a HTML report. Take a look at the shell script [dashboard.sh](view/dashboard.sh). 
Click on `Scheduled Jobs` and schedule this shell script to run on a recurring basis. Each run will save
[pipelinedashboard.ipynb](view/pipelinedashboard.ipynb) as a HTML file.
